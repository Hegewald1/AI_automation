If the given score is closer to 0 it means a negative review and the closer to 1 the more positive the review, ??where 0.5 would be neutral.??

Although the words to describe the plot, music, acting etc. might seem negative they can don't have to be in most circumstances (in my opinion).
I did this in the first 2 examples, where I got the following scores:

Next I wanted to try the example we have been talking about during the lessons a lot of the time.
Here I wrote some really positive sentences to start of with and ended the review with a "NOT" indicating it was the opposite.

Lastly I wanted to try with mixed sentences, both negative and positive sentences in the review.
Result is as follows: *screenshots + comments*
